* We now have a list of things that we check during a review! This allows us to get consistent code style and a better quality. Those docs are so so so important!

* We got 21 modules with puppet-strings!
* we provide it as REFERENCE.md in the repo which is embedded into the forge
* does anybody want to have html docs at voxpupuli.org/$modulename? (would be possible)

some explanation: bastelfreak noticed in the Archlinux community that people are happy, if you send them sweets

We tried this in the Puppet community as well. Puppet Inc. received 15pounds of sweets for all their encouragement for the community.

You all keep contributing and bastelfreak will send you sweets as well!

CERN people liked this so much and they use so many of our modules that they send out christmas giftcards to us

* story time: Everytime one popular module is broken, people will join the Vox Pupuli IRC channel
* This happend twice for stdlib (we didn't break it, we just noticed it)
* bastelfreak once added a breaking change to the systemd module which killed the openstack CI pipelines (happened twice)
